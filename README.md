# Brain_Cancer_Classifier + CAM

This project was a combination of CNN model classification problem (to predict wheatear the subject has brain tumor or not) &amp; Computer Vision problem. The final accuracy is much higher than 50% baseline (random guess). However, it could be increased by larger number of train images or through model hyperparameters tuning.

**Introduction:**

Brain tumours are classified based on their speed of growth and the likeness of them growing back after treatment. They are mainly divided into two overall categories: malignant and benign. Benign tumours are not cancerous, they grow slowly and are less likely to return after treatment.

Modern imaging methods such as MRI can be used for multiple diagnostic purposes; they can be used to identify the tumour locationâ€”which is used for investigating tumour progression and surgical pre-planning. MR imaging is also used to study the anatomy of the lesion, physiology, and metabolic activity along with its haemodynamics. 

Therefore MR imaging remains the primary diagnostic modality for brain tumours.

**Methodology**

Network models used in this research, implementation details, pre-training and training methods, data augmentation techniques, dataset information, data pre-processing steps, and finally, the evaluation metrics.
