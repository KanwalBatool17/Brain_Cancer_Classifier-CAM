# Brain_Cancer_Classifier-CAM
This project was a combination of CNN model classification problem (to predict wheatear the subject has brain tumor or not) &amp; Computer Vision problem. The final accuracy is much higher than 50% baseline (random guess). However, it could be increased by larger number of train images or through model hyperparameters tuning.
